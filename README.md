# Heart-Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models


The health care industry is inundated with vast amounts of data, necessitating the use of various techniques to manage it. Unfortunately, strokes afflict individuals worldwide, making prompt medical attention crucial. Heart strokes are the leading cause of death globally and are similar to heart attacks, which affect the heart's 
blood vessels. To predict heart strokes, different features can be utilized. An Effective Heart Stroke Prediction System (EHSPS) has been developed using machine
learning algorithms to predict heart strokes. The data set used for this system is classified based on 12 parameters, including hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and 
smoking status, among others. These inputs are then used to predict heart strokes using machine learning algorithms. The project's objective is to construct a machine  learning model that can accurately predict heart strokes.
